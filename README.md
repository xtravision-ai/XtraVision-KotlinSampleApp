# XtraVision-KotlinSampleApp

### Quick Start:

1. Clone the repo using below command:
   `git clone https://github.com/xtravision-ai/XtraVision-KotlinSampleApp.git`

2. Open cloned repo in `Android Studio` and open file: ` app/src/main/java/com/xtra/kotlin/example/MainActivity.kt`

3. Do required changes in file:

        // Set Required Variable
        val authToken = "__AUTH_TOKEN__"  // Put your auth token here
        val assessmentName = "SQUATS"		// Set your required assessment name here
        val selectedCamera = 0  //0: Front Camera, 1: Back Camera

4. Install and run this sample app on your physical device. (Due to some Google ML kit dependency, SDK can't work in the emulator. You need a physical device to run the sample app).

Please connect to Xtra Team to get auth -token and detail documentation for how to integrate SDK in your APP.
